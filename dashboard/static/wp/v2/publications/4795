In order to effectively protect the rights of all children and implement the 2019 UN Resolution on the Rights of the Child, the vulnerable and often invisible group of children living in institutions or at risk of being institutionalised must not be forgotten in the strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This paper contains joint recommendations on how to include children\u2019s right to family &#8211; and community-based care in the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><object class=\"wp-block-file__embed\" data=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Joint-Recommendations-for-the-EU-Strategy-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child_final-1.pdf\" type=\"application\/pdf\" style=\"width:100%;height:600px\" aria-label=\"Embed of Joint-Recommendations-for-the-EU-Strategy-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child_final-1.\"><\/object><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-eb26ac04-e0b7-4d8b-bd80-30f9238b4eb6\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Joint-Recommendations-for-the-EU-Strategy-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child_final-1.pdf\">Joint-Recommendations-for-the-EU-Strategy-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child_final-1<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Joint-Recommendations-for-the-EU-Strategy-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child_final-1.pdf\" class=\"wp-block-file__button\" download aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-eb26ac04-e0b7-4d8b-bd80-30f9238b4eb6\">Download<\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This paper contains joint recommendations on how to include children\u2019s right to family &#8211; and community-based care in the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":1759,"template":"","tags":[25,40,51,80,70],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.2 -
