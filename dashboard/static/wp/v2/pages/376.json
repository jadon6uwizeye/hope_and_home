Together we established an extensive volunteer network, providing support to children and their carers, helping them to access health, education and welfare services, as well as practical skills to improve their living conditions and livelihoods.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, we helped develop 13 community-based services and prevented over 8,600 children from being separated from their families. Over 2,000 participants in our specialist training programmes gained knowledge and child protection and care skills.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013 we began a new stream of work focused on identifying the scale and scope of institutional care across South Africa, along with the desire at national and provincial level to address it. This review led to significant interest from a number of Provincial Authorities to work with us in reforming the child protection system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"statistic-block_6228edd829002\"
