Since 2005, the organisation has represented Hope and Homes for Children in Moldova. Together, and in partnership with the central and local authorities in the country, they are working hard to eliminate orphanages and replace placement centres with family-based alternatives and community services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/ccfmoldova.org\/en\/home\">Visit CCF Moldova&#8217;s website<\/a>&#8230;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-block_6227b0fceae96\" class=\"image-block right yellow\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CCF-Moldova_Family_HopeandHomesforChildren-1920x870.jpg\" \/>\n  <\/div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>How we work together<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, and alongside other NGOs, we have made a considerable contribution to changing legal frameworks, funding, and public commitments. We have also helped increase the efficiency of the child protection system by providing training for relevant professionals. Thanks to our work, they are better informed, and empowered to act within the legal framework in the best interest of children. These professionals have become a real shield of protection for vulnerable children. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are currently focusing our work on reducing the number of children aged 0-6 in institutions. We are on course to eradicate institutional care for children under the age of three in the coming years. On top of this, we will continue to influence childcare reform efforts in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"statistic-block_6227b2ebeae97\" class=\"statistic-block yellow\">\n  \n      <h2>Our
