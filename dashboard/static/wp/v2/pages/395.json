Today, there are under 4,000 children living in 149 institutions; a fall of over 90%. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are still millions of children living in poverty, at risk of entering orphanages.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-block_622dd867fbafc\" class=\"image-block right yellow\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Miha\u0306escu-family-Romania_HopeandHomesforChildren-1920x870.jpg\" \/>\n  <\/div>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We wouldn\u2019t have made it without you.

We have developed a range of initiatives to strengthen families, including a network of day centres, emergency reception centres, mother and baby units and community centres.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>We develop alternative care for children without parental care<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For children who are unable to return to their biological families we have developed a number of alternative care services including foster care, small group homes, young adult support services, specialist emergency services and family-based care for children with special needs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>We transform child protection systems<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have worked closely with government and civil society in the development of policy, service standards and national action plans to underpin and consolidate reform of the child protection system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"statistic-block_622932b2d512d\" class=\"statistic-block yellow\">\n  \n      <h2>Our work in
