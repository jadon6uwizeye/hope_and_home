In 2016, the Bulgarian Government agreed to an action plan which will see the closure of all remaining institutions, including the remaining institutions for babies and young children, by the end of 2022.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Training social workers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our specialist training has reached over 2,600 social workers and other child protection professionals across the country, helping to support the deinstitutionalisation process and ensuring children\u2019s needs are always put first.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-block_6229168695d1e\" class=\"image-block right parallax yellow\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Ivan-stoyan-Bulgaria-on-scooter-scaled.jpg\" \/>\n  <\/div>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It was the happiest day of my life, when I took my boy back<\/p><cite>Stoyan, Ivan&#8217;s dad<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Preventing family breakdown<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our work to prevent family breakdown has seen us invest in a mix of bespoke family and community-based services including an emergency reception centre and a specialist centre for non-residential centre for children with behavioural difficulties. To date, we have successfully worked with over 2,000 children and their families.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Developing alternative care<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to pioneering a specialist centre for foster care, we have been able to successfully influence the Bulgarian Government in the development of a range of alternative care services such as foster care and young adult support programmes. We have worked closely with government and civil society in the creation of relevant policies, service standards and national action plans to underpin and consolidate reform of the child protection
