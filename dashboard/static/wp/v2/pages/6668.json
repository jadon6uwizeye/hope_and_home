Families are getting separated in the chaos, and children are travelling, unaccompanied, into foreign countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This war is not merely a humanitarian crisis for the people of Ukraine, but for the world. It has created a child protection emergency across the region. And it has exposed Ukraine\u2019s vast system of orphanages, housing <strong>100,000 children<\/strong> \u2013&nbsp;many of whom have been left to face the dangers of war alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hope and Homes for Children is working together with our local partners across Ukraine, Romania and Moldova to support the most vulnerable children and families on the brink of survival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 24 years&#8217; experience working in Ukraine, our teams were able to act fast. Since February 2022 we\u2019ve already <strong>supported more than 13,000 children in Ukraine<\/strong>, and over 9,000 refugees across Romania and Moldova. But we urgently need your help to scale up our response and reach more refugee families and unaccompanied children with life-saving support.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"link-block_62feda61cea4b\" class=\"link-block black\">\n    <div class='link_block_content'>\n          <h2 class='h1'>\n        <span>Ukraine Crisis Appeal<\/span>        We need your help    <\/h2>\n              <p>By giving to our regional response across Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania you can help protect children and families right now, and in the aftermath of this war.<\/p>\n              <p>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/donate.hopeandhomes.org\/give\/\" target=\"_self\">\n          <span>Donate now<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"30.7\" height=\"21.2\" viewBox=\"0 0 30.7 21.2\" xml:space=\"preserve\"><path fill=\"#000\" d=\"m20.1 0-2.2 2.2L24.7 9H0v3.2h24.7L17.9 19l2.2 2.2 10.6-10.6z\"\/><\/svg>        <\/a>\n      <\/p>\n      <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<p>If the total amount we raise exceeds what is needed to deliver our long-term response to this crisis, we will use donations where the need is greatest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we&#8217;ve achieved so far<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our achievements in Ukraine since 1998 mean we&#8217;re uniquely positioned to respond to this crisis.

response<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our work to ensure children and families are protected and supported will not end when the media attention dies down. Drawing on 24 years\u2019 experience working in Ukraine, our five-year regional response plan aims to <strong>lay the foundations for a scalable family-based care system<\/strong>. A system that will lead to the elimination of orphanages in Ukraine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine joining the European Union gives us an opportunity to collaborate with the Ukrainian authorities to \u2018build back better&#8217;. Together, we can work to create a strong, effective child protection system with families at its core. With a focus on Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, we will:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Strengthen families<\/strong> \u2013 by providing humanitarian and psychosocial support, and developing community-based service models to prevent family breakdown and avoid the need for institutional care;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Close baby homes<\/strong> \u2013 and demonstrate alternative, family-based care services for children without parental care;<\/li><li><strong>Advocate at national and EU levels<\/strong> \u2013 to shut down Ukraine\u2019s orphanage system and ensure sufficient support to achieve this, always in the best interests of children.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in Moldova and Romania, we continue to support refugee families, unaccompanied children and children evacuated from orphanages in Ukraine. We&#8217;re providing their basic needs and offering essential psychosocial support until they can return safely to Ukraine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, we&#8217;re working in close partnership with others including the Ukrainian authorities, the European Union, the UK Government, UNICEF and Save the Children.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"story-block_62fedcb8cea4c\" class=\"story-block right grey\">\n      <div class=\"story_block_image\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-of-children-being-evacuated-from-Ukraine-800x560.jpg\" \/>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"story_block_content\">\n          <h3>Evacuating 43 vulnerable children<\/h3>\n              <p>Between 16-18 March 2022, our teams in Ukraine and Romania worked together to evacuate 43 vulnerable children, nine carers, and their families (including 11 additional children), from the \u2018It\u2019s Good at Home\u2019 Centre in Dnipropetrovsk, when it became too unsafe to stay there. \u2018At night the train lights were out,&#039; Daria, our regional coordinator explains. &#039;And we didn\u2019t want any mobile phone lights to be seen from outside, in case we came under fire. We also had to reassure the children not to be scared if they heard sirens, or if the train stopped suddenly.\u2019 <\/p>\n          <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2>About Hope and Homes for Children<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every child deserves the love and belonging of a safe family home\u2013never the violence, abuse and neglect suffered in orphanages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hope and Homes for Children is an international charity that works to stop the institutionalisation of children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 1994, we\u2019ve inspired the UN, EU and local and national governments worldwide, from Romania to Rwanda, to close the doors of orphanages forever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In their place, we fight to keep families together, to reunite them, and to create new ones \u2013 always working with children, for children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Top photo: Ukrainian refugees cross the border into Romania at Siret in freezing temperatures.
