We do this by logging whether emails we send have been opened, deleted and interacted with, for example, by clicking on links within the emails. We use this information to look at general patterns and to help us better target our activities so that we only send information in this way to people we believe still want to receive the emails they\u2019ve consented to receive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Finding other people like you who might like to hear from us:<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may use the email and postal addresses you give us to help find more people like you, so that we can grow our supporter base through our online and offline channels.&nbsp; We use third party services to do this which you are likely to be familiar with, including Google, Facebook and Twitter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Analysing our supporter base to deepen relationships with, and tailor communications to, people who might support our work with higher donations:<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may gather information about you from publicly available sources \u2013 for example, Companies House, the Electoral Register, land records, the Charity Commission of England and Wales, the Scottish Charity Regulator, and the media \u2013 to help us to understand more about you as an individual and your ability and interest to support our work, including financially.&nbsp; Through our research, we aim to collect information about your philanthropic interests, for example, trusteeships or board memberships. We take this approach in order to ensure that we develop relationships appropriately and that you always receive the most appropriate communications. This also helps ensure that our fundraising activity is as effective as it can be. In some cases, for example in the case of very large donations, this information is also helpful for due diligence purposes. We may also carry out wealth screening, either in-house or through trusted third-party partners with whom we have appropriate data protection agreements in place, to ensure that any approach for financial support is sensitive and appropriate.
