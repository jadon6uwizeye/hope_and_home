Recently, the country has embarked on a care reform process that aims to reduce reliance on institutional care, prevent separation of children, and strengthen family and community-based care.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we do<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Share expertise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, Hope and Homes for Children facilitated a learning visit for Kenyan government officials to Rwanda. In 2019, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/what-we-do\/where-we-work\/rwanda\/\">HHC Rwanda team<\/a> was invited by the Kenyan government to hold a workshop with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unicef.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">UNICEF<\/a> and government officers in Kenya involved in the implementation and oversight of a pilot project on implementations of the <a href=\"https:\/\/bettercarenetwork.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Guidelines%20for%20the%20Alternative%20Family%20Care%20of%20Children%20in%20Kenya.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Guidelines for the Alternative Family Care of Children in Kenya<\/a>. The workshop included an in-depth case management training on prevention\/gatekeeping and the transition from institutional to family and community-based care.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Support the government to reform care and child protection systems<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2020, and alongside <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unicef.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">UNICEF<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.changingthewaywecare.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Changing The Way We Care<\/a> and other stakeholders, HHC has been supporting the government of Kenya in the development of key guidelines and toolkits for care reform. A major output has been the National Care Reform Strategy which has been finalised and is awaiting launch. The strategy will thrive to ensure all children in Kenya live safely, happily and sustainably in family and community-based care where their best interests are served.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Work with regional partners on care reform<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, in November 2016, Hope and Homes for Children, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visionafrica.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vision Africa<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.childandfamilyfocus.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Child in Family Focus<\/a> and nine other organisations, representing seven countries across Africa, became founder members of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/what-we-do\/how-we-work\/project-partners\/africa-transform-alliance-africa\/\">Transform Alliance Africa<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"navigation-block-block_622cf0b276dcc\" class=\"navigation-block right grey\">\n      <div class=\"navigation_block_image\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Carroll_HopeandHomesforChildren-1280x1080.jpg\" \/>\n    <\/div>\n  \n  <div class=\"navigation_block_content\">\n          <h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/what-we-do\/how-we-work\/project-partners\/africa-transform-alliance-africa\/\" target=\"_self\">Transform Alliance Africa<\/a><\/h3>\n        \n          <p>In November 2016, alongside 15 organisations representing seven countries, we established an alliance called Transform Alliance Africa (TAA).
