During that time, he\u2019s worked with colleagues to build on the firm foundations laid by his predecessors to almost treble our income and treble our impact. He spends much of his time building partnerships with other organisations, including with the private sector, to mobilise the skills and resources needed to help progress our ambition to make orphanages an unacceptable way of caring for children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark is clear about his motivation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cOrphanages deprive children of their liberty. Too often they replicate the conditions of a prison. They regiment the lives of children, stigmatise and isolate them from their families and communities. They inflict violence and neglect upon them. In the worst cases, orphanages are engines of child trafficking. They are harmful and have no place in our society. Despite continuing resistance though, we have great confidence that change is in fact possible, and at scale. With every day, more governments, local authorities and organisations are recognising that helping to keep families together, and supporting alternative forms of family and community care and protection are not only more cost effective than concentrating and locking resources up in orphanages, but are actually saving lives and radically improving many more.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark was previously the CEO of War Child. He currently serves as a Trustee on the Board of Barnardo\u2019s, and is also the Chair of the Barnardo\u2019s Foundation Advisory Board. He was awarded the CBE for services to international child protection in the 2019 New Years Honours.<\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<p><a id=\"Angharad McKenzie\"> <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Angharad McKenzie<br>Director of Global Marketing, Communications and Fundraising<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Angharad-McKenzie-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-1024x864.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4021\" width=\"840\" height=\"708\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Angharad-McKenzie-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-1024x864.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Angharad-McKenzie-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-300x253.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Angharad-McKenzie-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-768x648.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Angharad-McKenzie-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><figcaption>Angharad McKenzie Director of Global Marketing, Communications and Fundraising<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Angharad joined Hope and Homes for Children in 2017.
