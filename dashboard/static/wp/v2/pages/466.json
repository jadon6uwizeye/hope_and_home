Together, we strengthen child protection mechanisms, set up community services and connect children and families with the support they need to prevent separation.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>About CINI<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CINI is an Indian non-government organisation, working with and for poor and marginalised children in India. For more than 40 years, they\u2019ve been supporting disadvantaged children and women to improve their health, nutrition, education and protection. They do this through partnering with local communities as well as central and state government and national and international donors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinindia.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Visit CINI&#8217;s website<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-block_6227849b49066\" class=\"image-block right yellow\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CINI-with-Sonia-and-her-mum_HopeandHomesforChildren-1920x870.jpg\" \/>\n  <\/div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why we partnered with CINI<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CINI already offered a wide range of child protection services across India. They were working closely with the child protection sector and state governments, who play a key role in delivering programmes to support children. They\u2019d shown their commitment to strengthening families. Thanks to them, many communities had better access to education, health services, and vocational skills, and had developed their child protection skills.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How we work together<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By combining CINI&#8217;s positive track record and relationships with communities and government departments, and our technical expertise, we can <strong>strengthen CINI&#8217;s ability to continue developing alternative care systems<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We work across two districts in the Jharkhand State (Ranchi and Khunti) to <strong>strengthen the formal and informal child protection mechanisms, establish and support community services, and link children and families to support schemes to prevent separation<\/strong>. We\u2019re working with two institutions directly, and another five through district government departments, to make sure they successfully reintegrate children into their families and to help transform their services.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"statistic-block_6227857349067\" class=\"statistic-block yellow\">\n  \n      <h2>Our impact<\/h2>\n  \n  <div class=\"statistic_container\">\n
