There, she found&nbsp;Uwera, a newborn baby girl, abandoned on the ground. Atete did not hesitate. She scooped&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;up, took her home and cared for her for three weeks while the community tried to find&nbsp;Uwera\u2019s parents. Once it was clear that no trace could be found, the authorities insisted that&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;must betaken to an orphanage. Atete was heart-broken. She knew that the last thing an orphanage would provide was the first thing that&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;needed; someone to love her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are now decades of reliable research to show that orphanages do not protect children, they harm them. Orphanages expose children to neglect and abuse and deny them the love and individual care that\u2019s so crucial to their development and well-being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atete was determined to do all she could to help&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;survive alone in the orphanage without her. She spent far more than she could afford, buying clean feeding bottles, ensuring the&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;was vaccinated and registering her birth. And once&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;entered the institution, Atete and her children tried to visit as often as they could, despite the many obstacles that were placed in their way by the staff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a year and without any warning,&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;was transferred to another institution, over 50 miles away. No one would tell Atete where to find her. Our team in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/what-we-do\/where-we-work\/rwanda\/\">Rwanda<\/a> tell us that conditions in the second orphanage were some of the worst they have ever seen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the next 18 months,&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;was confined to a single room alongside fifty other children. She was left for days on end in the same, filthy nappy. She slept on the floor with insects crawling over her and she was fed just once every 24-hours. Shouted at if she made the slightest noise,&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;stayed silent and struggled simply to survive. As a result of this abuse and neglect, by the time she was two and half,&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;was still tiny for her age and she could neither walk nor talk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Uwera_HHC_HopeandHomesforChildren-1024x864.jpg\" alt=\"Uwera smiling and holding a balloon\" class=\"wp-image-1235\" width=\"840\" height=\"708\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Uwera_HHC_HopeandHomesforChildren-1024x864.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Uwera_HHC_HopeandHomesforChildren-300x253.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Uwera_HHC_HopeandHomesforChildren-768x648.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Uwera_HHC_HopeandHomesforChildren.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><figcaption>With her new family to love and encourage her,&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;is overcoming the trauma of her time in the orphanage<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Thankfully, by this time, the Rwandan Government\u2019s groundbreaking commitment to end the use of orphanages meant that our specialist child protection team in Rwanda was able to work with their local authority partners to close the orphanage and give&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;back her childhood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our first step was to discover as much as we could about&nbsp;Uwera\u2019s story in case there was a chance to reunite her with her birth family. That is when we learned about&nbsp;Uwera\u2019s existing bond with her foster mother and approached Atete to see if she would be able to welcome&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;back into her home. Atete was overjoyed at the chance to be reunited with the baby girl that she had rescued and taken to her heart once before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A skilled social worker from our local team was assigned to the case and carried out the appropriate checks to make sure that the match would be safe and sustainable for&nbsp;Uwera. Then they worked with Atete and her family to make sure they had the training and resources they needed to care for&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;and help her to overcome the trauma of her time in the orphanage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atete remembers how shocked she was when she first saw&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;again; she was so tiny and frail. \u201cI felt as though I was carrying a dead body,\u201d Atete told us. When she bathed&nbsp;Uwera, water pooled in the deep gaps between her daughter\u2019s neck and her collarbones. But since then, with great love and patience, Atete has begun to rebuild&nbsp;Uwera\u2019s strength and confidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uwera&nbsp;has been with her new family for 2 years now and today she can walk and talk, she can run and she can jump. Atete\u2019s older children love to play with their little home. Soon she will begin nursery, alongside the other children in her community, and Atete has applied to officially adopt&nbsp;Uwera&nbsp;so that they can never be separated again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like&nbsp;Uwera, for children confined to an orphanage, whose birth families are unable to keep them safe, an alternative family solution is always best.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"link-block_622e5eb04c5a8\" class=\"link-block yellow\">\n    <div class='link_block_content'>\n          <h2 class='h1'>\n        <span>Support our work<\/span>        Help us build new families    <\/h2>\n              <p>No child should spend their childhood in an orphanage.<\/p>\n              <p>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/donate.hopeandhomes.org\/give\/\" target=\"_self\">\n          <span>Donate now<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"30.7\" height=\"21.2\" viewBox=\"0 0 30.7 21.2\" xml:space=\"preserve\"><path fill=\"#000\" d=\"m20.1 0-2.2 2.2L24.7 9H0v3.2h24.7L17.9 19l2.2 2.2 10.6-10.6z\"\/><\/svg>        <\/a>\n      <\/p>\n      <\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Uwera was abandoned in a bush as a baby.
