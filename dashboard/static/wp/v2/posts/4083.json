Three years ago, Buddhi\u2019s husband became uncontactable, leaving her and her daughters in a very vulnerable situation.&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Maya was four years old when her parents made a difficult decision to admit her to Asha Orphanage in Chitwan District. \u201cThere was no good school in our village,\u201d Buddhi explains. \u201cNani (daughter) did not want to go. We cried the whole night until dawn broke and it was time for her to go. We did not want her to but the situation was very difficult for us.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For seven long years Buddhi Maya had not seen her daughter, Maya, while she was in the orphanage. <em>\u201c<\/em>Every night when I tucked my three daughters to sleep, I missed Maya and imagined her sleeping peacefully next to her sisters but the emptiness always made me cry.\u201d\u00a0<em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June 2021, Maya was removed from the orphanage with the collective help of the local, central authorities and our organisation and was reunited with her family.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buddhi, Maya\u2019s mother remembers: \u201cWhen Maya came home after such a long time, I did not know much about my own daughter. Sending my daughter away had made us strangers.\u201d\u00a0 With the help of our education and family support, today Maya is with her mother and sisters, which she had dreamed of for so long.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buddhi Maya said to Bina, our Reintegration Officer: \u201cThe support your organisation lit a sense of hope inside me that I can provide for my daughters no matter what struggles may arise.\u201d&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>From learning her ethnic language to sharing things as sisters, each day has been a learning experience for Maya.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Buddhi Maya is now providing for her four daughters<\/strong>\u00a0<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, their house is a happy place due to the loving bond between mother and her four daughters. Maya and her sisters are working hard in their studies and do the household work while their mother is in work. Buddhi Maya knows that what she earns is a minimum wage but she is willing to struggle endlessly to provide for her daughters.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her daughters understand the hardships their mother has been facing to provide for the family. \u201cWhen you have daughters, they will have many necessities,\u201d Buddhi Maya explains. \u201cI have not been able to provide many necessary things but they understand when I say we will buy it next time.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from her daily earnings, Buddhi Maya also looks after the tomato farm she cultivated in a leased land as a part of our income generation support.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Maya_Livelihood-support-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"A smallholding tomato farm with plants growing under a plastic awning in Nepal\" class=\"wp-image-2666\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Maya_Livelihood-support-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Maya_Livelihood-support-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Maya_Livelihood-support-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Maya_Livelihood-support-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Maya_Livelihood-support-720x540.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Maya_Livelihood-support.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Growing tomatoes helped Maya&#8217;s family bring her home from the orphanage<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Continuing schooling during the pandemic<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Maya is currently studying in Grade 8.
