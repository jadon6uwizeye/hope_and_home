Now he would be travelling in a small, twin engine plane, high into the Himalayas, back to his home district of Humla, one of the most remote areas of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/what-we-do\/where-we-work\/nepal\/\">Nepal<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like so many children from Humla, Tika had been taken from his family by traffickers. For a high fee, they promised his parents that he would be well cared for and educated in an institution in the city. Instead, he was taken to an orphanage where he survived alone for two years. He was neglected, abused and exploited to elicit donations from tourists.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Covid-19 emergency began, the owners of the orphanage&nbsp;shut up&nbsp;shop. The children whose families&nbsp;lived&nbsp;nearby&nbsp;were&nbsp;sent straight home,&nbsp;with no planning or preparation. But&nbsp;Tika and two other little boys whose families&nbsp;lived&nbsp;hundreds of miles away over the mountains, were&nbsp;virtually&nbsp;abandoned and&nbsp;left to fend for themselves&nbsp;for weeks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tika survived alone for two years, neglected, abused and exploited to elicit donations from tourists.&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Nepali&nbsp;child protection authorities discovered what had happened, they asked our local partners,&nbsp;the NGOs,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/what-we-do\/how-we-work\/project-partners\/forget-me-not-nepal\/\"><strong>Forget&nbsp;me&nbsp;Not&nbsp;<\/strong><\/a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/thisngonepal.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>The Himalayan Innovative Society (THIS)<\/strong><\/a>, to&nbsp;care for the&nbsp;children at their transit home&nbsp;and&nbsp;help&nbsp;reintegrate&nbsp;them with their families.&nbsp;Over the summer,&nbsp;their&nbsp;skilled family tracers, managed to&nbsp;find and&nbsp;contact&nbsp;the children\u2019s&nbsp;parents&nbsp;and prepare&nbsp;everyone to&nbsp;be&nbsp;reunited.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On the morning of October 2020, Tika and three other children \u2013&nbsp; Prani, Deepa and Sonika \u2013 began their journey home.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&nbsp;were introduced to a dedicated social worker called&nbsp;Tenzin Lama. With long experience of reuniting children from orphanages with their families,&nbsp;he had come to accompany the children to the airport.&nbsp; \u201cThey were all smiling with nervousness and excitement\u201d,&nbsp;Tenzin&nbsp;told us. \u201cOn the way, I answered their questions and talked to them about what to expect when they arrived, how living in a family&nbsp;is&nbsp;different to living in an orphanage\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the airport, once the necessary Covid checks had been made,&nbsp;Tenzin entrusted the children to his&nbsp;fellow Reintegration Officer,&nbsp;Mangal Lama,&nbsp;who&nbsp;guided and reassured&nbsp;them&nbsp;through their&nbsp;hour-long&nbsp;flight&nbsp;through&nbsp;the mountains,&nbsp;to&nbsp;Simikot,&nbsp;3,000 feet above sea level and&nbsp;the main town in&nbsp;Humla&nbsp;district.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cOn the way, I answered their questions and talked to them about what to expect when they arrived, how living in a family&nbsp;is&nbsp;different to living in an orphanage\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p><cite>Tenzin Lama, social worker<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>At&nbsp;7.40am, they landed safely back home.&nbsp;The children were met by&nbsp;Prabhujan&nbsp;Shahi, another&nbsp;member of the reintegration team. A few days before, he had contacted the children\u2019s parents and confirmed their&nbsp;journey plan, giving them&nbsp;time to travel&nbsp;from their villages,&nbsp;to be there when their children landed. Local officials were also on hand, to ensure that all proper procedures were followed and&nbsp;guardianship of the children was&nbsp;legally&nbsp;restored to their families.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, once all the paperwork and checks&nbsp;had been completed,&nbsp;the social workers and the officials stepped back and allowed Tika, Prani, Deepa and Sonika to be alone with their families&nbsp;for a&nbsp;short&nbsp;time,&nbsp;before&nbsp;making&nbsp;the final arrangements for them to return home to their villages.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe could see the happiness and love in the faces of the parents and their children.
