They have also announced that 50,000 disabled children are now set to remain warehoused in its Soviet-style institutions indefinitely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Government of Ukraine\u2019s policy about-turn ignores a series of disturbing reports about the country\u2019s orphanage system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hope and Homes for Children\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/hopeandhomes.org.ua\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/zvit_2020_eng-stysnuto.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Behind the Mask of Care study<\/a>&nbsp;revealed how vulnerable children in Ukraine are often misdiagnosed with medical conditions and prevented from attending mainstream schools. Parents are then coerced into sending them to institutions, far away from their families. Our study found that 86 per cent of babies in one orphanage were misdiagnosed with serious illnesses.

Together, we\u2019re calling on the European Union (EU) to put pressure on the Government of Ukraine to revive plans to dismantle its orphanage system. It follows a similar call to action which we made in December 2020 with 21 NGOs, but which was ignored by Ukraine\u2019s Cabinet of Ministers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf Ukraine continues to lock up babies and disabled children, it will violate international law and commit tens of thousands of children to a childhood of confinement and misery.\u201d says Mark Waddington CBE, the CEO of Hope and Homes for Children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2019 UN Resolution on the Rights of The Child, which the Government of Ukraine supported, commits all 193 member states to eliminating orphanages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark added: \u201cUkraine\u2019s orphanage system is huge and a major draw on the public purse, employing 60,000 people. The funding that supports these salaries and buildings could be far more effectively deployed to reintegrate children back with their families or, where this isn\u2019t possible, develop alternative family care arrangements like fostering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cVitally, these funds could be used to prevent family break up and separation in the first place, by being used to address housing problems or respond to childcare needs while parents work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe EU must act now to stop Ukraine from reneging on its obligation to children, and recommit to eliminating its orphanage system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBecause children always belong in families\u2013never orphanages.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU has a track record of supporting Eastern European non-member states to dismantle their orphanage systems, including in pre-accession Romania, where 100,000 children living in institutions has reduced to 4,500 in just 20 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cUkraine\u2019s orphanage system is huge and a major draw on the public purse\u2026 The funding that supports these salaries and buildings could be far more effectively deployed to reintegrate children back with their families\u201d<\/p><cite>Mark Waddington, CEO of Hope and Homes for Children<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Poverty, the pressures of single parenting, substance abuse, the war in Crimea and impact of Coronavirus have seen many children unnecessarily taken into institutions in Ukraine.
