In Borodianka, 98% of government buildings &#8211; schools, kindergartens, foster homes, health, administration &#8211; have been destroyed. This not only disrupts education and health services for children, it also prevents parents from getting back to work.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Our incredible team here are supporting some of the most vulnerable families with food, medicine and blankets. But the development of services that can endure over the medium to long term is important too. So, we\u2019ve been discussing what the key needs are and how we can assist with local administrations. This will be especially important for children who are too often overlooked in humanitarian responses, like those with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/why-it-matters\/inclusive-societies\/\">disabilities<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong><em>May 3rd, 2022<\/em>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With Halyna, our inspirational country director, here in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/what-we-do\/where-we-work\/ukraine\/\">Ukraine<\/a>. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we\u2019re assessing the damage a Russian rocket wrought &nbsp;on a school. It ripped through a second floor classroom, utterly destroying it. Tank shells have pockmarked the football pitch. The children were still in the school but were marshalled into the basement just in time. It is a miracle that no one was killed. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schools provide vital safe spaces and ways of including vulnerable children. The invasion turned that upside down. Online schooling is now being rolled out but access to the internet is patchy and not everyone has the kit. We\u2019re planning to help with that. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Halya-in-a-destroyed-school-Ukraine_HopeandHomesforChildren-1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Our Country director for Ukraine, Halya, standing in the ruins of a school\" class=\"wp-image-4867\" width=\"840\" height=\"472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Halya-in-a-destroyed-school-Ukraine_HopeandHomesforChildren-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Halya-in-a-destroyed-school-Ukraine_HopeandHomesforChildren-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Halya-in-a-destroyed-school-Ukraine_HopeandHomesforChildren-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Halya-in-a-destroyed-school-Ukraine_HopeandHomesforChildren-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Halya-in-a-destroyed-school-Ukraine_HopeandHomesforChildren-1.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Halya-in-a-destroyed-school-Ukraine_HopeandHomesforChildren-1-800x450.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><figcaption>Ukraine country director Halyna Postoliuk standing in the ruins of a classroom<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h4><strong><em>May 4th 2022<\/em>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve just visited a maternity unit which had experienced repeated shelling \u2013 despite the huge signs making it clear it &nbsp;is a hospital. New mums and babies were inside when the building came under fire. Incredibly, they managed to escape.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>63,000 babies have been born since the start of the invasion. We know from Bosnia and other places that parents transmit their trauma to children, even if the child wasn\u2019t alive during the conflict. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Older children have lived through terrifying moments themselves. Their trauma will have lifelong consequences if not attended to, making them vulnerable to being taken into care.

But, we know that the trauma can be mitigated and\/or prevented with the right mental health interventions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re in the process of developing a mobile mental health outreach service in the worst hit towns around Kyiv.

They picked up another 5 families along the way &#8211; all mums with their children. Fuel is short here and they were in danger of running out before getting to safety. Ivan spotted a damaged Russian tank just off the road, hopped out of the van with a rubber hose and siphoned the diesel out of it. Our team got them all accommodation and provided them with food when they arrived in Dnipro.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Then, there\u2019s young Dmytro, 14 years old, whose father was killed by Russian shelling and so has been caring for his mum who is living with disabilities. He had the help of his Gran. Then she died. Dmytro had to dig her grave and place her in it. No child should have to endure that. We are providing him and his mum all the support we can.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I had the privilege of meeting Lyudmila, head of the child protection department in Borodianka. The wanton murder, rape and shooting of hundreds of civilians, including children, is beyond grief. She carries this burden heavily, but with dignity and duty. Our team will be working with her to help rebuild the protection services and infrastructure that is vital in supporting families to protect and care for their children, including those with disabilities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Our hope is that we will achieve all this by building a system that prevents children from being separated from their families and taken into care. Or, when necessary, provides them with alternative forms of family care. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will be aiming to focus a significant part of that system on the 100,000 children associated with Ukraine&#8217;s orphanages: those still confined in them; those sent back home without any preparation or planning; and those vulnerable to being locked up in them &nbsp;the majority of whom have disabilities and are being punished for that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I cann\u2019t imagine finer humans than Lyudmila or my colleagues across Hope and Homes for Children to create the opportunity to succeed in this endeavour.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And to everyone who is supporting us. Thank you.
