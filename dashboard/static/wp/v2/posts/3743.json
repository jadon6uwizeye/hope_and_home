Tanya became pregnant with the twins when she was working abroad to earn money for the family. Ivan agreed to stand by his wife, even though the babies were not his, and Kaloyan and Maria were born soon after Tanya returned home. It was a traumatic birth that ended in an emergency caesarean section and left Tanya suffering from post-natal depression. At the same time, Ivan was admitted to hospital to receive treatment for a heart condition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tanya felt completely alone. \u201cI listened to the nurses in the hospital who behaved very badly. They said, \u201cHow can you even want to look at your black children? Better you give them up, right?\u201d, she remembers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Tanya felt completely alone. &#8220;I listened to the nurses in the hospital who behaved very badly.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>With no one to support her, Tanya felt she had no choice and made the heart-breaking decision to leave Kaloyan and Maria in an orphanage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI cried constantly when I signed to give them up because I grew up without a mother or a father. They left me very young, in a home and I just didn\u2019t want my children to be the way I was.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Bulgarian-twin-Maria-blowing-bubbles-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"A little mixed race girl in a pink jacket blows bubbles into the air\" class=\"wp-image-2219\"\/><figcaption>Maria spent the first five months of her life separated from her family in an orphanage after ill-health threatened to tear their family apart.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>She returned home to Ivan and their older children but could not come to terms with losing the twins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI neither ate nor slept peacefully, just wondering how my kids were. How are they in this orphanage without me?\u201d, she explains. Tanya was desperate to find a way to be reunited with her babies. And Ivan decided to support her decision. Even though everyone in their small rural community would know they were not his biological children, even though he was well aware of the prejudice they would face, he was determined to make their family whole again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI neither ate nor slept peacefully, just wondering how my kids were.
