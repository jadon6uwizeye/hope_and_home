In May 2021, her father Ravi died from Covid. Since her father was the sole breadwinner, the family were plunged into financial crisis.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Our world turned upside down. I had no idea how to support my family without my husband. There aren\u2019t any nursery or childcare services available in my village. And on top of this, the schools were closed due to Covid, so&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;was sent home from school.&#8221;<\/p><cite>Radha,&nbsp;Sonia\u2019s mum<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since schools closed,&nbsp;Sonia\u2018s education was suddenly cut short. With her mother out looking for work,&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;spent long periods alone, at risk of being trafficked for child marriage, child labour or prostitution, never to see her family again. All while coming to terms with the traumatic loss of her father.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unable to find work, in desperation, Radha considered making the heartbreaking decision to send&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;to an orphanage, so she would at least get three meals a day. But decades of research show that orphanages don\u2019t protect children, they harm them. To feel safe and happy, to learn, develop and really thrive, all children need to know that they are loved, and they belong; they need families.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But decades of research show that orphanages don\u2019t protect children, they harm them.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Determined to prevent&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;from ending up in an orphanage, our expert local partners,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/what-we-do\/how-we-work\/project-partners\/child-in-need-institute-cini-india\/\">Child In Need Institute (CINI)<\/a><strong>,<\/strong>&nbsp;stepped in and provided Radha with the support she needed to keep her family together. Thanks to funding and technical support from Hope and Homes for Children, CINI have trained community health volunteers in the area to identify vulnerable children at risk of ending up in loveless institutions. They have also developed a new mobile app called KoboCollect which rapidly speeds up the process of getting the right support to these families before it\u2019s too late.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preethi, a local community volunteer trained by CINI, soon identified&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;as being vulnerable. \u201cDuring one of our home visits,\u201d Preethi says, \u201cwe found out that&nbsp;Sonia\u2019s father had died of Covid, and that the whole family had come to a standstill. The family was facing financial crisis.\u201d Thanks to CINI\u2019s app, Preethi was able to support&nbsp;Sonia\u2019s family quickly and efficiently. \u201cWe submitted all the family\u2019s details and highlighted their case as a red flag, so the district administration was notified,\u201d Preethi explains. \u201cThen we presented the case to the district administration and successfully got support for&nbsp;Sonia\u2019s education and got her mother onto the Widow\u2019s Pension and Food Security schemes.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI will work hard to make sure that my children have everything they need, and whatever hardship they may face in their lives, I will always go the extra mile to support them.\u201d<\/p><cite>Radha,&nbsp;Sonia\u2019s mum<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Preethi also helped enrol&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;in a free government residential school nearby. Here,&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;will be well looked after while her mum is looking for work and can still see her family on the weekends and go home for the holidays.<br>Crucially, Preethi also provided emotional support, empathy, and hope.&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;remembers, \u201cThe CINI team visited us and helped us believe that we could overcome our situation.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without the app developed by CINI, children like&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;are falling through the cracks at an alarming rate. Your money is helping us use innovative digital technology to protect Covid orphans like&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;from loveless institutions.<br>With&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;back in a classroom and the family\u2019s basic needs covered,&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;is no longer at risk of being trafficked or sent to an orphanage and can stay with her family\u2014where she belongs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sonia\u2019s mum, Radha, says: \u201cThis support from CINI and the government prevented me from losing my daughter. She is back at school now and we all are living happily together. I will work hard to make sure that my children have everything they need, and whatever hardship they may face in their lives, I will always go the extra mile to support them.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sonia&nbsp;is loving being back at school. She feels positive about the future now and is able to enjoy playing with her friends again, and her three-year-old brother, Ajeet. She says, \u201cI am very happy that now I can continue my education and live a happy life.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-block_622b1dde76c7e\" class=\"image-block left parallax purple\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Sonia-running-in-India_HopeandHomesforChildren-1920x870.jpg\" \/>\n  <\/div>\n\n<div id=\"link-block_622b2350125db\" class=\"link-block black\">\n    <div class='link_block_content'>\n          <h2 class='h1'>\n        <span>Support our work<\/span>        Help end orphanages for good.    <\/h2>\n              <p>Ensure children like Sonia stay safe and loved at home<\/p>\n              <p>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/donate.hopeandhomes.org\/give\/\" target=\"_self\">\n          <span>Donate now<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"30.7\" height=\"21.2\" viewBox=\"0 0 30.7 21.2\" xml:space=\"preserve\"><path fill=\"#000\" d=\"m20.1 0-2.2 2.2L24.7 9H0v3.2h24.7L17.9 19l2.2 2.2 10.6-10.6z\"\/><\/svg>        <\/a>\n      <\/p>\n      <\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For every two Covid deaths, one child becomes a covid orphan.
