Every year approximately 1.6 million people volunteer overseas, with voluntourism being considered the fastest growing \u2018trend\u2019 in travel,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/trove.nla.gov.au\/work\/26237192?selectedversion=NBD43606931\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">worth&nbsp;an estimated $2.6 billion per year<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Good intentions have disastrous outcomes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part,&nbsp;voluntourists&nbsp;are well-intentioned people, looking for an opportunity to travel and contribute to the countries they visit. Sadly though, when it comes to volunteering in orphanages, these&nbsp;volunteers&nbsp;risk harming rather than helping children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can volunteering abroad be positive?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the right circumstances, volunteer tourism provides significant benefits for both volunteers and communities that receive them.  But we must be absolutely clear: volunteering in children\u2019s institutions is a bad idea.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ask yourself this: would you be happy for a volunteer&nbsp;from overseas, with no experience and no background checks, to help out at your&nbsp;local&nbsp;school or nursery?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I can guess your answer.  Yet this is exactly what&#8217;s happening in when foreign volunteers work in orphanages abroad.&nbsp;What many volunteers don&#8217;t know is that around 80% of the 5.4 million children housed in orphanages, are not orphans at all. Most are separated from their families because of poverty, disability or discrimination. Once confined to these large and loveless&nbsp;facilities, even babies and very young children are deprived of the vital one-to-one care and attention that every child needs&nbsp;to develop properly&nbsp;and to thrive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>100 years of research &#8211; orphanages harm children <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Years of robust research show that institutions harm children. The lack of individual love that is characteristic of institutional care, damages children\u2019s emotional, physical and neurological development. The results can last a lifetime.&nbsp;Yet, with the growth of volunteer tourism or &#8216;voluntourism&#8217;, there&#8217;s an increasing trend for people, often young and from higher income countries, to spend time helping in orphanages in other parts of the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Voluntourism: More harm than good - The Feed\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/jr3Kp9v9j2g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch the short interview below \u201cVoluntourism: More harm than&nbsp;good\u201d with Leigh Mathews co-founder&nbsp;of the cross-sector coalition, ReThink Orphanages<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voluntourism&nbsp;in orphanages leaves children vulnerable to abuse where child protection regulations are lax. It creates attachment problems in children; they become close to short-term visitors. And it perpetuates the myth that many of these children are orphans in need of adoption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Orphanage voluntourism and orphanage tourism: What\u2019s the difference?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In many countries, Children in orphanages are exploited as \u2018attractions\u2019 for tourists. This perpetuates the orphanage economy and allows the proliferation and sustainment of institutions. This is \u201cOrphanage Tourism\u201d; tourist visits to orphanages as part of packages, day trip excursions or tours. The impact on children can be critical because of the cyclical, short-term nature of the visits and the experience of being treated as a tourist attraction. The need to attract tourists to visit orphanages can even mean children are purposefully kept in poor conditions.  They can be denied food, clothing and other essentials in order to attract more money from visitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>In this light, orphanage tourism can be seen as a form of child exploitation<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This&nbsp;short&nbsp;animation&nbsp;shows&nbsp;the impact that volunteers have on children in orphanages&nbsp;from a child\u2019s point of view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Dear Volunteer\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/c6NlLnfH3tg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Love You Give campaign\u2014take the volunteering pledge<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As members of the coalition,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rethinkorphanages.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Rethink Orphanages<\/strong><\/a>, we&#8217;ve added our voice to&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.loveyougive.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>The Love You Give<\/strong><\/a>, #ChangeVolunteering campaign.
