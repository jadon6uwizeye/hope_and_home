Staff still remain in Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk, providing support to internally displaced persons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, we have provided assistance by providing hygiene products, soft inventory (mattresses, bed linen, towels, blankets), and disposable tableware to over 100 families. These are families who have arrived in the region and without current further travel arrangements. In addition, we\u2019ve provided assistance to over 350 refugees.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the stories of some of the children and families affected. <\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"story-block_62693bc52137b\" class=\"story-block left grey\">\n      <div class=\"story_block_image\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Taped-up-windows-in-Ukraine-800x560.jpg\" \/>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"story_block_content\">\n          <h3>Anna&#039;s story<\/h3>\n              <p>&quot;Just a month ago, we had been a happy family, had a business, a home. Now everything has changed. The shelling, sirens, fires have started. You are lying in bed and you hear the planes flying. On 4 March, our grandmother died. Old woman, darling, good. My son, who is 14 years old, had to dig her grave. She was born during the war, and died during the war. First, people were buried when there was an opportunity, where we could. Now, human bodies are lying on the streets in the open air. On 17 March 2022, we managed to get out. We are staying with relatives&#8230; sleeping on the floor, homeless.&quot;<\/p>\n          <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<div id=\"story-block_6269349521379\" class=\"story-block right grey\">\n      <div class=\"story_block_image\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Child-with-backpack-at-Ukraine-border-800x560.jpg\" \/>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"story_block_content\">\n          <h3>Yuliia&#039;s story<\/h3>\n              <p>\u201cWe survived 2014.

So my husband got behind the wheel and we left. There are 2 roads for leaving the city, and you do not know which one to choose. There was black smoke in front of us. The military said that maybe the enemies had already finished shooting, and we could take a risk that they would not shoot us. So  we took the risk. Now we&#039;re living with acquaintances.
