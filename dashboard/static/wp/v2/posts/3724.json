But orphanages do not protect children; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/why-it-matters\/how-orphanages-harm-children\/\">they harm them, <\/a>exposing children to neglect and abuse and damaging their development. Because the one thing an orphanage can never provide is the first thing that every child needs; someone to love them.<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When&nbsp;Mihai&nbsp;was eight years old, he was shut in a small room by himself for three weeks with no toys, no books and no one to talk to. Staff in white coats and plastic gloves watched him through a large internal window and passed him food three times a day. This was the Isolation Unit in the orphanage in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/what-we-do\/where-we-work\/moldova\/\">Moldova<\/a> where&nbsp;Mihai&nbsp;had been sent because his family had nowhere to live. His mum, Valentina, was struggling to care for&nbsp;Mihai&nbsp;and his new-born baby sister, Amelia, on her own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authorities gave Valentina and Amelia a place in a Mother and Baby Unit and sent&nbsp;Mihai&nbsp;to the orphanage. They believed he\u2019d be safer there. But orphanages do not protect children; they harm them, denying children the love and individual care that\u2019s so vital to their development, their happiness and their well-being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe children were sad there. All of them were somehow afraid of their carers.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, every new child that enters the orphanage where&nbsp;Mihai&nbsp;was sent, even babies and toddlers, spend 21 days alone in the Isolation Unit to make sure they\u2019re not carrying any infections. It\u2019s hard to imagine what a traumatic experience this must have been for&nbsp;Mihai, so soon after being separated from his mum and his sister. When this ordeal was finally over,&nbsp;Mihai&nbsp;spent a further six months in the main orphanage, with no one to love or protect him. \u201cThe children were sad there,\u201d he told us. \u201cAll of them were somehow afraid of their carers.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWho will love&nbsp;Mihai&nbsp;if not me?\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Valentina is a loving and courageous mother who knew from bitter experience what her son would be going through. She spent her own childhood, confined to a loveless institution, after both her parents died in a car crash. \u201cWho will love&nbsp;Mihai&nbsp;if not me?\u201d she asked us in despair. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"680\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/RS42_Mihai_01_RF_Moldova-1024x680.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3727\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/RS42_Mihai_01_RF_Moldova-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/RS42_Mihai_01_RF_Moldova-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/RS42_Mihai_01_RF_Moldova-768x510.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/RS42_Mihai_01_RF_Moldova.jpg 1181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Mihai&nbsp;was overjoyed to be reunited with his Mum, Valentina and his sister, Amelia, after spending months alone in an orphanage.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s when our partner CCF Moldova stepped in. A local team of skilled and dedicated professionals, they worked with the local child protection authorities to reunite&nbsp;Mihai&nbsp;with his family.
