Along with this, they have produced several satirical, awareness-raising videos. In 2017, they have also developed the below&nbsp;<strong>Social Media Guide for Volunteers and Travelers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAn increasing number of people spend their holidays or gap years traveling, while at the same time doing something meaningful and different.&nbsp;<strong>Language and images can either divide and make stereotypical descriptions<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 or&nbsp;<strong>unify, clarify and create nuanced descriptions of the complex world we live in<\/strong>. It can be difficult to present other people and the surroundings accurately in a brief social media post. Even though harm is not intended, many volunteers and travelers end up sharing images and text that&nbsp;<strong>portray local residents as passive, helpless and pitiful \u2013 feeding the stereotypical imagery instead of breaking them down<\/strong>. This is your go-to guide before and during your trip. Use these four guiding principles to ensure that you avoid the erosion of dignity and respect the right to privacy while documenting your experiences abroad.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">PRINCIPLE 1: PROMOTE DIGNITY<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Promoting dignity is often ignored once you set foot in another country, particularly developing countries. This often comes from sweeping generalizations of entire people groups, cultures, and countries. Avoid using words that demoralize or further propagate stereotypes. You have the responsibility and power to make sure that what you write and post does not deprive the dignity of the people you interact with. Always keep in mind that people are not tourist attractions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">PRINCIPLE 2: GAIN INFORMED CONSENT<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Informed consent is a key element in responsible portrayal of others on social media. Respect other people\u2019s privacy and ask for permission if you want to take photos and share them on social media or elsewhere. Avoid taking pictures of people in vulnerable or degrading positions, including hospitals and other health care facilities. Specific care is needed when taking and sharing photographs of and with children, involving the consent of their parents, caretakers or guardians, while also listening to and respecting the child\u2019s voice and right to be heard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">PRINCIPLE 3: QUESTION YOUR INTENTIONS<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Why do you travel and volunteer? Is it for yourself or do you really want to make a difference? Your intentions might affect how you present your experiences and surroundings on social media, for instance by representing the context you are in as more \u201cexotic\u201d and foreign than it might be. Ask yourself why you are sharing what you are sharing. Are you the most relevant person in this setting? Good intentions, such as raising awareness of the issues you are seeing, or raising funds for the organization you are volunteering with, is no excuse to disregard people\u2019s privacy or dignity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">PRINCIPLE 4: USE YOUR CHANCE \u2013 BRING DOWN STEREOTYPES<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you travel you have two choices: 1. Tell your friends and family a stereotypical story, confirming their assumptions instead of challenging them. 2. Give them nuanced information, talk about complexities, or tell something different than the one-sided story about poverty and pity. Use your chance to tell your friends and stalkers on social media the stories that are yet to be told. Portray people in ways that can enhance the feeling of solidarity and connection. A good way forward is to ask the local experts what kind of stories from their life, hometown, or country they would like to share with the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.radiaid.com\/social-media-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>social media checklist<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;for volunteers and travellers from Radi-Aid, Africa for Norway:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"784\" height=\"637\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/social-media-checklist-volunteers-and-travellers-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3460\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/social-media-checklist-volunteers-and-travellers-1.jpeg 784w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/social-media-checklist-volunteers-and-travellers-1-300x244.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/social-media-checklist-volunteers-and-travellers-1-768x624.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.radiaid.com\/social-media-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>download the guide at this link<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>To know more about voluntourism and how to choose the right program<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that in the right circumstances, volunteer tourism provides significant benefits for both the volunteers and the communities that receive them but we need to be absolutely clear:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/blog\/orphanage-volunteering\/\"><strong>volunteering in an orphanage abroad is a bad idea<\/strong><\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re thinking about volunteering abroad,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/uncategorized\/want-to-volunteer-abroad-heres-your-volunteering-10-point-checklist\/\"><strong>here\u2019s what to look for to make sure your time overseas is genuinely spent making a difference<\/strong><\/a>: check out this\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/blog-article\/volunteering-10-point-checklist\/\"><strong>10-point <\/strong><\/a><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/uncategorized\/want-to-volunteer-abroad-heres-your-volunteering-10-point-checklist\/\">checklist<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0to make sure you know what to look out for when you select your volunteering program abroad.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Even if we know that in the right circumstances, volunteer tourism provides significant benefits for both the volunteers and the communities that receive them but we need to be absolutely clear:\u00a0volunteering in an orphanage abroad is a bad idea.<br \/>\nIt is increasingly important to address how volunteers and travellers tell their story on, to make sure that language and images are used to make a positive impact and break stereotypes, rather than reinforce them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":3588,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[35,36],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>A 4 point guide for volunteers and travellers - Hope and Homes<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"It is increasingly important to address how volunteers and travellers tell their story on\u00a0social media.
