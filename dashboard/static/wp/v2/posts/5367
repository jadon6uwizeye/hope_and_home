Now, they have the support they need to stay together and decide their own future.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>At 16 years old, Munni is carrying a heavy weight on her young shoulders, but her younger brother,&nbsp;Dilip, can still make her laugh. Their father died a year ago and poverty forced their mother to remarry. Since then, Munni has been struggling to look after&nbsp;Dilip&nbsp;by herself. Until recently, she had dropped out of school and was taking whatever work she could find to make ends meet, but it wasn\u2019t enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon&nbsp;Dilip&nbsp;dropped out of school, too. He was embarrassed to go without a proper uniform and they couldn\u2019t afford to buy one. Munni was desperately worried about her brother. At just eleven years old, he was spending his days, roaming the village with nothing to do and she knew he was at risk of being sent to grow up at an orphanage with no one to love or protect him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>\u201cWe have worked with the local child protection committee to link&nbsp;Dilip&nbsp;to a sponsorship scheme that will provide him and Munni with a small income.\u201d<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>But today, thanks to your support for our work, Munni and\u00a0Dilip\u00a0are still together and their future looks a little brighter. Through our local partners in the rural part of east India,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cini-india.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Child in Need Institute (CINI)<\/a>, Hope and Homes for Children is working to help vulnerable children to stay with their families and in their communities. In this way we can stem the flow of children into orphanages that threaten their wellbeing and life chances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Munni_Dilip_HopeandHomesforChildren-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"With your help, Munni and Dilip can continue their education and their future prospects are brighter and more positive.\" class=\"wp-image-1041\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Munni_Dilip_HopeandHomesforChildren-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Munni_Dilip_HopeandHomesforChildren-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Munni_Dilip_HopeandHomesforChildren-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Munni_Dilip_HopeandHomesforChildren-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Munni_Dilip_HopeandHomesforChildren.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Munni_Dilip_HopeandHomesforChildren-800x450.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We have persuaded&nbsp;Dilip&nbsp;to go back to school and given him the resources he needs to study. At the same time, we have worked with the local child protection committee to link&nbsp;Dilip&nbsp;to a sponsorship scheme that will provide him and Munni with a small income. Munni too is feeling more positive about the future. Our partners have arranged for a tutor to visit the village and work with her and some of the other teenage girls. This means she can continue her studies without having to risk walking 5km to the nearest secondary school on her own or worry about leaving&nbsp;Dilip&nbsp;by himself. Life is still tough, and their situation remains fragile, but Munni is confident that she can take care of her little brother now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we ask&nbsp;Dilip&nbsp;what he\u2019d like to be when he grows up, he says he wants to be a policeman and catch thieves. But like most eleven-year-olds, he\u2019s far more interested in the here and now than answering questions about the future. He doesn\u2019t want to be rude but as soon as we\u2019ve finished our talk, he slings his school bag in through the door and dashes off to play with his friends. Munni rolls her eyes and smiles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"link-block_62c2dadfbdb61\" class=\"link-block black\">\n    <div class='link_block_content'>\n          <h2 class='h1'>\n        <span>Support our work<\/span>        Help keep children out of orphanages    <\/h2>\n              <p>On average it costs just \u00a345 to identify a vulnerable child at risk of being separated from their family.  <\/p>\n              <p>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/donate.hopeandhomes.org\/give\/\" target=\"_self\">\n          <span>Make a donation<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"30.7\" height=\"21.2\" viewBox=\"0 0 30.7 21.2\" xml:space=\"preserve\"><path fill=\"#000\" d=\"m20.1 0-2.2 2.2L24.7 9H0v3.2h24.7L17.9 19l2.2 2.2 10.6-10.6z\"\/><\/svg>        <\/a>\n      <\/p>\n      <\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dilip\u00a0was in danger of being separated from his big sister, Munni, and sent to an orphanage.
