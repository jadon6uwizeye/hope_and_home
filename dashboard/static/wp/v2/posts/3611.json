I was there, I heard it first-hand,\u201d remembers Andreea, our social worker, of her meeting the Mih\u0103escu family back in February 2021. \u201cIt made my heart skip a beat. Almost reflex-like, I covered Federica\u2019s ears when he said it. I knew the family\u2019s situation needed rapid improvement, but I wasn\u2019t ready for this. Certainly, not then, not that quickly.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, all six children and both parents were living in just one nine-square-meter room. Somehow, two tattered beds and a small table managed to fit in. Ion used to work in construction as a day labourer, but, after lockdown and with construction sites being on and off, he couldn\u2019t find work. Cristina was taking care of children, particularly the new-born. She used to work for a drycleaner, but was now at home nursing Gabriela, with minimum pay. Her low salary and the children\u2019s social benefits \u2013 that\u2019s all there was. And that was supposed to be enough for baby food, diapers, meds, food for the entire family, clothes. How can that be enough? It simply wasn\u2019t. The Mih\u0103escus were living without electricity or access to any other utilities: no heat, no gas. They got water from a nearby well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The Mih\u0103escus were living without electricity or access to any other utilities: no heat, no gas. They got water from a nearby well.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI had to propose a plan to the Child Protection Department. We\u2019ll help with improving the living conditions and with enrolling the kids in school. \u2018Will that work as a rapid intervention?\u2019, I asked. Luckily, they were on board,\u201d remembers Andreea of her initial proposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CPD and the local City Hall helped with enrolling all children in school. Only Federica had ever gone to school, but she had dropped out. She wanted to go back. \u201cWhat would I wear? I don\u2019t have any shoes,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started by getting the family basic staples: food, clothing, hygiene items. With no electricity there was no fridge, so we focused on canned items, flour, oil, cornflower. We were in crisis mode, basically. The bare minimum, for starters. And then shoes and clothing for the kids.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then focused on bringing electricity in. It took two months, but the family has electricity now. We bought a fridge, a washing machine, a woodburning stove. For the first time, there was heat inside the home. A makeshift roof covered the fridge and the washing machine. But not for long. We bought construction supplies, bricks, cement, everything that was needed to build another room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIon did everything. He was a brick mason, a carpenter, a roofer, a concrete finisher, depending on what was needed,\u201d says Andreea. He kept repeating, \u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes, just don\u2019t let them take our kids away.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon enough, we had two rooms. Ion goes to school, too, as part of a government-funded program for adults who had dropped out of school. Construction sites are back on, so he\u2019s out working every day. Gabriel, the oldest son, works alongside Ion on weekends. Cristina will return to her job when Gina turns two. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have made it without you. God bless you. I would never let go of my children\u201d, says Cristina.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s still work to be done: we need to bring plumbing inside the home and new furniture for the two rooms. We want to ensure the children stay in school. They still need our support, especially around those moments when any family spends a bit more than the usual. When schools started, for example, we helped with supplies, notebooks, pens, backpacks. Or now, around the holidays, a bit of help is still needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have made it without you. God bless you.
