In early March, we started to shape our response to the refugee crisis.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, we are helping families living in 16 refugee accommodation centres (RACs) in the northern part of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/what-we-do\/where-we-work\/moldova\/\">Moldova<\/a>. We will begin working in two more RACs in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on signed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/what-we-do\/how-we-work\/how_we_close_orphanages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MoUs (Memorandum of Understanding)<\/a> with local public authorities, in all 16 RACs we have provided hygiene and food supplies, focusing on more specific items such as baby food and hypoallergic food items. We have also equipped free play corners to be open around the clock for children and their families. We have set up informative corners and provided arts &amp; crafts supplies for children. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>At the end of February, the world as we know it changed. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One mom told us that reading together was a big part of her and her son&#8217;s routine when they were home. But when she left, she had not managed to pack any books. We have provided them with books to read, and drawings to look at &#8211; bringing back a small piece of normalcy for her and her son.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another RAC in northern Moldova, a 12-year old has asked for acrylic paints so she can pursue her hobby and put in colours her emotions. She told us that her father works abroad while she, her mum and younger brother are in Moldova. She really wants to go back home to her friends and grandparents. She told her father that she is getting better at her art and she will sell some of her paintings so they get the money to go back home, and life can return to how it was before the war.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>She told her father that she is getting better at her art and she will sell some of her paintings so they get the money to go back home<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Some families are making longer term plans. They are planning what to do if the war continues and their home towns are not safe to return. One mum with a 15-year old plans to move out of the RAC and go to Chisinau to find work. She plans to enrol her son in a local school, mentioning that \u201ceducation is the most important asset.\u201d They will need support in finding employment, legal advice on contracting, support with school enrolment and other move-related priorities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some RACs, we are planning structured activities with caregivers and children to support their social-emotional development. 8 staff members have received training to do this from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.warchildholland.org\/projects\/teamup\/timeline-ambition\/#:~:text=TeamUp%20provides%20refugee%20children%20with,method%20is%20being%20used%20worldwide.\">War Child Netherlands in TeamsUp<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally to ensure integration, we plan to pilot a voucher based intervention for both refugee and host families, based on several criteria \u2013 age, disability, family size etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Moldova-child-playing-with-Toys_HopeandHomesforChildren-1024x864.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4841\" width=\"840\" height=\"708\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Moldova-child-playing-with-Toys_HopeandHomesforChildren-1024x864.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Moldova-child-playing-with-Toys_HopeandHomesforChildren-300x253.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Moldova-child-playing-with-Toys_HopeandHomesforChildren-768x648.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Moldova-child-playing-with-Toys_HopeandHomesforChildren.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><figcaption>A young boy playing with toys in a Moldovan RAC (CCF Moldova)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n<div id=\"text-image-block_62876dc4279b5\" class=\"text-image-block left yellow\">\n  <div class=\"text_image_block_container\">\n    <div class=\"text_image_block_image\">\n              <img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Liliana-Rotaru_CCFMoldova-800x560.jpg\" \/>\n          <\/div>\n    <div class=\"text_image_block_content\">\n              <p>Liliana Rotaru is the chairperson of CCF Moldova, our partner organisation in Moldova.<\/p>\n                <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<div id=\"link-block_62876fb6279b6\" class=\"link-block black\">\n    <div class='link_block_content'>\n          <h2 class='h1'>\n        <span>Ukraine Crisis Appeal<\/span>        We Need your help    <\/h2>\n              <p>By supporting our work across Ukraine, Moldova and Romania you can help protect children and families right now and in the aftermath of this war.<\/p>\n              <p>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/donate.hopeandhomes.org\/give\/\" target=\"_self\">\n          <span>Donate now<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"30.7\" height=\"21.2\" viewBox=\"0 0 30.7 21.2\" xml:space=\"preserve\"><path fill=\"#000\" d=\"m20.1 0-2.2 2.2L24.7 9H0v3.2h24.7L17.9 19l2.2 2.2 10.6-10.6z\"\/><\/svg>        <\/a>\n      <\/p>\n      <\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Liliana Rotaru, chair of our partner organisation CCF Moldova, shares how her team are responding to the refugee crisis in Moldova.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":23,"featured_media":4829,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[72,42,25,33,43,9],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.2 -
