His mum,&nbsp;Mubyeyi&nbsp;and his dad,&nbsp;Kubana, knew something was wrong because Carrol has a twin sister, Estrella, and the difference between the two babies was stark.&nbsp;Mubyeyi&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kubana&nbsp;were desperate to&nbsp;do their best for Carrol but with little free support for children with additional needs in their area, they didn\u2019t know where to turn. Then they heard about an orphanage in another district, a long way from their home, which cared for children with mental and physical disabilities. It seemed their only hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But orphanages do not protect children, they harm them. Decades of reliable research show that orphanages expose children to neglect and abuse and damage their&nbsp;development. Because the last thing that any orphanage can provide is the first thing every child&nbsp;needs; someone to love them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrol was taken to the orphanage when he was three and spent two years there, fending for himself in poor conditions alongside scores of other children and young adults with severe learning and physical impairments. His parents visited whenever they could and worried for his future but could see no other option for their child.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2012, Hope and Homes for Children has been working in partnership with the Rwandan Government to help deliver its&nbsp;groundbreaking&nbsp;commitment to close the country\u2019s orphanages and make it possible for all children to grow up in safe and loving families.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Carroll_Rwanda_HopeandHomesforChildren-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"A young Rwandan boy, Carrol, sits on the ground between his win sister, Estrella, and his older brother, Eric.\" class=\"wp-image-1901\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Carroll_Rwanda_HopeandHomesforChildren-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Carroll_Rwanda_HopeandHomesforChildren-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Carroll_Rwanda_HopeandHomesforChildren-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Carroll_Rwanda_HopeandHomesforChildren-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Carroll_Rwanda_HopeandHomesforChildren.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Carroll_Rwanda_HopeandHomesforChildren-800x450.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Carrol, one of the children we worked with, and his two siblings. Now Carrol is growing up as part of a family and a community, instead of isolated in an orphanage.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, our team began working with their local authority partners to close the orphanage where Carrol lived and reunite the children with their parents or other close relatives by making sure that families have the support they need to care for their children at home. Two members of our skilled local team of child protection professionals in Rwanda were assigned to support Carrol and his family through the reunification process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard, an experienced child psychologist, spent time with Carrol\u2019s parents, explaining why the orphanage was not the right place for their son. He gave Mubyeyi and Kubana the confidence to believe that, with the right support, they could bring Carrol home and care for him themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe beautiful part of the story is that as we explained to parents the kind of miracle that the parent-child attachment can provide to a young child, they immediately embraced the idea of bringing Carrol home, Richard remembers. \u201cThey were willing to endure all the sacrifices they have to make to keep their child with them. It was amazing to see their willingness,\u201d he adds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard\u2019s colleague, Bonaventure, is Carrol\u2019s case manager. A trained social worker, he prepared Carrol to leave the orphanage and made sure his family had access to the resources, support and information they needed to care for him long-term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December 2018, Carrol and his family were reunited and now he is where he belongs, back at home with the people who love him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonaventure will continue to monitor Carrol\u2019s case and make sure he stays safe and happy. So far, he\u2019s very pleased with the way that Carrol has adapted to being back at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCarrol\u2019s favourite toy is his tennis ball and he loves playing catch with his twin, Estrella, and his big brother, Eric. He is growing stronger and more mobile everyday,\u201d Bonaventure reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having Carrol home again has been good for everyone. \u201cWe used to be distressed, wondering how our child was being treated in the institution but now we are quite sure of how he is treated because he is in our hands,\u201d Carrol\u2019s Mum,&nbsp;Mubyeyi&nbsp;confirms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonaventure\u2019s next goal is to secure a nursery place for Carrol so that he can play and learn alongside, Estrella, and the other children in his community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, Carrol\u2019s mum and dad have built a wooden bar in the back yard to help him learn to stand and walk and, with their love and encouragement, he is making progress every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With your support, we can reunite families torn apart by orphanages and bring children home to the people who love them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Always family.

Since 2010 we have been supporting the Government of Rwanda in the elimination of institutions throughout the country and on the development of a\u00a0national child protection system\u00a0that minimises family separation and\u00a0provides family-based alternatives\u00a0when necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team assisted with the\u00a0closure of 13 orphanages\u00a0across the country including\u00a0Rwanda\u2019s oldest and largest institution\u00a0Orphelinat Noel de Nyundo and helped\u00a0transition\u00a0over 1,300 children\u00a0into families and communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2012, the Rwandan Government becomes the first government in Africa to commit to closing orphanages.
