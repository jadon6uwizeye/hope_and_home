In December 2021, after 27 years, we closed our operations there so that we can re-direct our funds to other countries where we can have greater impact. Here, Anisija Radenkovic, our Country Director for 16 years, reflect on our greatest achievements during that time.<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We are immensely proud of what we have achieved over the years. We helped unite our two governments, we secured investment from the EU for child protection reform, and we&nbsp;<strong>showed that&nbsp;deinstitutionalisation&nbsp;is possible<\/strong>.&nbsp;We brought knowledge and expertise and supported the development of several family and community services for families and children. Our Active Family Support&nbsp;programme&nbsp;was&nbsp;recognised&nbsp;by local government and also UNICEF as one of the most effective prevention&nbsp;programmes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My proudest achievement is the creation of the&nbsp;<strong>Children and Youth Council&nbsp;<\/strong>\u2013 a group of over 50 children and youth from the childcare system or families at risk of separation who now have the opportunity to share their voices with government.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Members-of-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Youth-Council-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"A table in a conference room with young people sitting along it smiling\" class=\"wp-image-3820\" width=\"840\" height=\"472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Members-of-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Youth-Council-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Members-of-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Youth-Council-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Members-of-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Youth-Council-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Members-of-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Youth-Council-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Members-of-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Youth-Council-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Members-of-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Youth-Council-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-800x450.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><figcaption>Members of our Children and Youth Council<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly we directly supported children to make sure that they have the chance to thrive in a strong, supported family:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We reduced the number of children without parental care from approximately 4,000-5,000 children, to&nbsp;<strong>1,600<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/li><li>We helped&nbsp;<strong>over 5,000 children<\/strong>&nbsp;from 1,700 families&nbsp;to stay together, not to be separated.&nbsp;<\/li><li>We helped&nbsp;<strong>over 350 children<\/strong>&nbsp;to leave harmful institutions and grow up in a natural family environment.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Family-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3821\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Family-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Family-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Family-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Family-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Family-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Family-Hope-and-Homes-for-Children-800x450.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>A family we supported to stay together in 2010.
