No warning, no support\u201d, he remembers. \u201cIt was terrible for&nbsp;Ivan.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His son was just three years old then, but because Stoyan was a single parent on a very low income and his child had cerebral palsy, the authorities had decided&nbsp;Ivan&nbsp;would be safer in an orphanage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But orphanages do not protect children; they harm them.&nbsp;Ivan&nbsp;spent the next two years heavily medicated and confined to a cot in a darkened room on the top floor of the institution, alongside all the other children with disabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt was horrible\u201d, Stoyan remembers. \u201cI\u2019m a labourer and I was working 12 to 15 hours a day because I couldn\u2019t sleep. My friend told me, \u201cIf you carry on like this, you\u2019ll kill yourself.\u201d I was waking up in the night and crying because&nbsp;Ivan&nbsp;wasn\u2019t with me\u201d, he says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Ivan_Bulgaria_HopeandHomesforChildren-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Ivan and his dad, Stoyan spend a lot of time together.

Total zero care. They tied him into a wheelchair. Before then,&nbsp;Ivan&nbsp;was beginning to stand and walk with support and he had started to speak. He could say mummy and daddy,\u201d Stoyan angrily recalls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For two years, Stoyan fought a lonely battle against red-tape, prejudice and indifference, to be reunited with his son.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFirst, if I take my boy home, the institution loses income!\u201d, he explains. \u201cThen, even when I went to court and won full custody of my son, the institution just ignored it,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elitsa&nbsp;Ivanova is a member of Hope and Homes for Children\u2019s specialist social work team in Bulgaria. She has spent the last four years, working to close the orphanage where&nbsp;Ivan&nbsp;was taken, by reuniting children with their parents, building new parents through fostering and adoption and keeping vulnerable families together by providing the support that parents need to care for their children at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI could see the love Stoyan had for his child,\u201d she says, \u201cbut no one was supporting him. The local child protection department lied to him. They kept setting him tasks and challenges but when he met them, each time the authorities let him down again. It really made me angry!\u201d, she recalls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cStoyan was losing faith\u201d, she says. \u201cHe needed to meet someone who believed in him and who he could trust,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause he is a man on his own, people could not see him as the parent for a child with a disability. I told them, \u201cI can see how he cares for his child and I know he will do his best for him.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Elitsa set to work. She helped Stoyan find a better place to live and complete the paperwork to claim the child support he needed to prove he could provide for&nbsp;Ivan. She also made sure their new home was equipped with essentials, including a stove for heating, clothes and the right kind of toys for&nbsp;Ivan. At the same time, Elitsa helped Stoyan to take on the authorities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I told them, &#8216;I can see how he cares for his child and I know he will do his best for him.&#8217;\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMany times, Elitsa intervened and told the social workers that I was the best person to take care of my son even though I am a man, I could take good care of my son by myself,\u201d he confirms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"864\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Elitsa_Bulgaria_HopeandHomesforChildren-1024x864.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3733\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Elitsa_Bulgaria_HopeandHomesforChildren-1024x864.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Elitsa_Bulgaria_HopeandHomesforChildren-300x253.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Elitsa_Bulgaria_HopeandHomesforChildren-768x648.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Elitsa_Bulgaria_HopeandHomesforChildren.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Elitsa&nbsp;Ivanova is a member of Hope and Homes for Children\u2019s specialist social work team in Bulgaria. She has worked tirelessly to help&nbsp;Ivan&nbsp;reunite with his loving dad, Stoyan.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But just as vital was the emotional support and encouragement that Elitsa provided.<br>\u201cI can\u2019t put it into words\u201d, Stoyan says now. \u201cI have shared so much with Elitsa. Without her, I don\u2019t know how I would have been able to carry on. I really trust her 100%\u201d. I know she would never lie to me. She knows things I have never told anyone else.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, Stoyan and Elitsa overcame every hurdle that was placed in their way and in June 2018, Stoyan and&nbsp;Ivan&nbsp;were reunited.<br>\u201cIt was the happiest day of my life, when I took my boy back, Stoyan remembers. \u201cNow, we like to do everything together. He is very affectionate. He hugs and kisses me. He likes my stubbly chin so I don\u2019t shave for him!\u201d he says, laughing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays,&nbsp;Ivan&nbsp;is a very active boy who responds well to other people and is curious about new adults and children.<br>Stoyan says he has seen a rapid improvement in his son\u2019s development since&nbsp;Ivan&nbsp;stopped taking the drugs that were prescribed by institution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His cerebral palsy means&nbsp;Ivan&nbsp;has problems controlling his speech and movement but now he can stand and walk by himself and is beginning to learn to speak again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;There are no challenges now. I just love my boy and I am not interested in anything else.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Ivan&nbsp;loves it when his dad sings folk songs to him. Stoyan strokes and sooths his son as he sings.&nbsp;Ivan&nbsp;rocks to the music and smiles and laughs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt was difficult, caring for him at first. For example, he only liked to eat bananas. Now I am helping him to learn to hold a spoon and feed himself. It\u2019s slow, but we are making progress,\u201d Stoyan explains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ivan&nbsp;attends the specialist rehabilitation service that Hope and Homes for Children has helped to establish in place of the institution. Elitsa has also made sure he receives regular speech therapy. And Stoyan is a very enterprising dad.<br>He successfully appealed to the viewers of a local TV show to help him raise funds for a mobility scooter, to take&nbsp;Ivan&nbsp;out and about. Now they can visit the park and the soft-play area at their favourite caf\u00e9 whenever they like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we asked Stoyan about the challenges he faces, he told us simply, \u201cThere are no challenges now. I just love my boy and I am not interested in anything else.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"link-block_622e4bbfb1edc\" class=\"link-block yellow\">\n    <div class='link_block_content'>\n          <h2 class='h1'>\n        <span>SUPPORT OUR WORK<\/span>        We need your help    <\/h2>\n              <p>Your donation will help us reunite children like Ivan with the people who love them the most.<\/p>\n              <p>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/donate.hopeandhomes.org\/give\/\" target=\"_self\">\n          <span>Donate now<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"30.7\" height=\"21.2\" viewBox=\"0 0 30.7 21.2\" xml:space=\"preserve\"><path fill=\"#000\" d=\"m20.1 0-2.2 2.2L24.7 9H0v3.2h24.7L17.9 19l2.2 2.2 10.6-10.6z\"\/><\/svg>        <\/a>\n      <\/p>\n      <\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ivan was taken from his dad, Stoyan, when he was just three years old.
