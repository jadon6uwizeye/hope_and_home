We worked with them to find a home where they would rebuild their lives.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was forced to go. I had no choice\u201d, Esmeralda says simply, remembering the night she left her husband, taking her six children and absolutely nothing else with her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Free from domestic abuse, free from orphanages: Esmeralda\u2019s story\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-Q-XPQKBcBw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her mother died when Esmeralda was very young and she spent part of her childhood living in an orphanage to escape her alcoholic father. She married as soon as she was old enough, hoping to find security. Her husband was kind to her at first, she says, but after their twin daughters were born, the beatings began. He refused to believe that the babies were his. Over the next six years, Esmeralda gave birth to three more daughters and a son, and the violence just got worse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI will never let my children go to an institution. I would rather die\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, fearing for her life, Esmeralda, took her children and fled to a refuge. With no family to support her, no income and no permanent place to live, she knew her children were in danger of being taken from her and left in an orphanage. But Esmeralda was absolutely determined not to let that happen. \u201cI will never let my children go to an institution. I would rather die,\u201d she told us then. \u201cEven if the staff are kind, even if everything is clean and the children are fed, you are on our own and there is no love there.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWhen Esmeralda fled from her husband, all she had with her were the clothes she was wearing\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/tag\/bosnia-and-herzegovina\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina<\/a> worked with Esmeralda and her children to rebuild their lives and keep their family together.&nbsp;Social worker Adnan Vrbanjac helped Esmeralda to find and furnish a small flat, register with a food bank and cover the cost of heat and electricity until she found her feet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Esmeralda fled from her husband, all she had with her were the clothes she was wearing and so, crucially, Adnan also supported her through the complicated process of obtaining new identity documents. Once she had these, Esmeralda was able to access social support for her children, register them for health care and make sure they could go to school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"978\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Esmeralda-Hope-and-Homes-For-Children-978x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Esmerelda holds her young son in the doorway of her flat, as five girls stand in the foreground looking at the camera\" class=\"wp-image-5473\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Esmeralda-Hope-and-Homes-For-Children-978x1024.jpg 978w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Esmeralda-Hope-and-Homes-For-Children-287x300.jpg 287w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Esmeralda-Hope-and-Homes-For-Children-768x804.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Esmeralda-Hope-and-Homes-For-Children-764x800.jpg 764w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Esmeralda-Hope-and-Homes-For-Children.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px\" \/><figcaption>We found a flat for Esmeralda and her six children to rebuild their lives in.
