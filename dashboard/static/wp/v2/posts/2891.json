A number of children with disabilities, reunited with their families through our work, are now calling on the UN to recognise orphanages as one of the biggest barriers to progress on creating safe, healthy and inclusive communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>First-hand accounts from people living with disability<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The work of Hope and Homes for Children in Rwanda has recently been the focus of attention for the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Through a number of online consultations starting in March, the United Nations Committee has been hearing first-hand accounts from children and adults living with disability, as well as from their representative organisations<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe United Nations Committee has been hearing first-hand accounts from children and adults living with disability\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Many disabled people experience isolation, lack of visibility and segregation. The United Nations Committee is working to ensure that everyone living with disability can live safely in their communities. However, one of the biggest barriers to inclusion is the use of orphanages\u2014a common response to the needs of children with disabilities. Yet, with the right support, these children could instead grow up in the care of a loving family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cOne of the biggest barriers to inclusion is the use of orphanages\u2014a common response to the needs of children with disabilities\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"536\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Participants-at-the-UNCRCs-2018-Day-of-General-Discussion-Photo-Child-Rights-Connect-1024x536.jpeg\" alt=\"A female participants at the UNCRC\u2019s 2018 Day of General Discussion including childcare reform\" class=\"wp-image-2896\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Participants-at-the-UNCRCs-2018-Day-of-General-Discussion-Photo-Child-Rights-Connect-1024x536.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Participants-at-the-UNCRCs-2018-Day-of-General-Discussion-Photo-Child-Rights-Connect-300x157.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Participants-at-the-UNCRCs-2018-Day-of-General-Discussion-Photo-Child-Rights-Connect-768x402.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Participants-at-the-UNCRCs-2018-Day-of-General-Discussion-Photo-Child-Rights-Connect.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Participants at the UNCRC\u2019s 2018 Day of General Discussion (Photo: Child Rights Connect)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>New set of childcare guidelines<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically hosted in-person, but moved online this year due to Covid, the United Nations Committee is relying on these consultations to inform a new set of childcare guidelines being drawn up. By the end of the year, these guidelines will show how children with disabilities can be cared for in family and community settings\u2014without the need for national and local authorities to ever resort to the use of orphanages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last few months, our team in Rwanda has been an observer at a number of these regional consultation events. In June, 170 individuals were invited to attend the session, with around 30 speakers sharing stories of their experience with all members of the United Nations Committee\u2019s African delegation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cIn June, 170 individuals were invited to attend the session, with around 30 speakers sharing stories of their experience with all members of the United Nations Committee\u2019s African delegation\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Reflections from care leavers in Rwanda and Kenya<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One child we helped return to their parents in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/what-we-do\/where-we-work\/rwanda\/\">Rwanda<\/a> had been confined to an institution for five years, simply because there weren\u2019t the services in the community that offered their parents the right support to care for them. Now a young person, reflecting back on their experience they told the United Nations Committee that children are often abandoned, and their parents never visit them again. \u201cThe institutions that separate them from their families are not solution,\u201d they claimed. \u201cHaving families is their right, being loved and supported is what children with disability need most, it is up to us all to strive for this, to advocate for this.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"536\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Participants-at-the-UNCRCs-2018-Day-of-General-Discussion-Photo-Child-Rights-Connect_2-1024x536.jpeg\" alt=\"A female participants at the UNCRC\u2019s 2018 Day of General Discussion including childcare reform\" class=\"wp-image-2897\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Participants-at-the-UNCRCs-2018-Day-of-General-Discussion-Photo-Child-Rights-Connect_2-1024x536.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Participants-at-the-UNCRCs-2018-Day-of-General-Discussion-Photo-Child-Rights-Connect_2-300x157.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Participants-at-the-UNCRCs-2018-Day-of-General-Discussion-Photo-Child-Rights-Connect_2-768x402.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.hopeandhomes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Participants-at-the-UNCRCs-2018-Day-of-General-Discussion-Photo-Child-Rights-Connect_2.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Participants at the UNCRC\u2019s 2018 Day of General Discussion (Photo: Child Rights Connect)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also taking part in the global consultation were two care leavers we supported in Kenya. One care leaver shared their concern at being \u201cmisunderstood and misrepresented.\u201d As a result, children are unable to influence what happens around them. \u201cIt\u2019s important the process of deinstitutionalisation is humanised,\u201d they added. \u201cChildren with disabilities in institutions give up on themselves, compromising their wellbeing.
